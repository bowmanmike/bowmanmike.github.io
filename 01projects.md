#### Here's a few projects I've been working on lately!

[BeOurGuest](http://evening-reaches-50428.herokuapp.com) is a group project that's meant to simulate a restaurant reservation system like OpenTable. Create an account, create a restaurant, and make a reservation!
Check it out on [github](http://github.com/bowmanmike/seatyourself)!

[Rainforest](http://damp-cliffs-11542.herokuapp.com/) is an Amazon-type site. Log in, add a product, and share reviews!  
Check it out on [github](https://github.com/bowmanmike/rainforest)!
