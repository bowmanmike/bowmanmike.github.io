![Mike Bowman](/assets/bitmaker_portrait_cropped.jpg){: .about-portrait }

I'm Mike, a Ruby on Rails developer in Toronto. I've just completed the Full-Stack web development bootcamp at at [Bitmaker](http://bitmaker.co), here in Toronto. Since studying history and philosophy at university, I've known I'd need a job where I’d be similarly challenged on a daily basis. After a roundabout journey through food service, Germany, as well as beer- and coffee-snobbery, I re-discovered coding. I was quickly reminded why I liked it in the first place, and decided to dive in. In coding, I’ve found an outlet for the creative, problem-solving part of myself, and find deep satisfaction in seeing my ideas come to life.

I'm interested in all aspects of Web Development, though I'd say my strengths lie in building out back-end logic. However, I understand the importance of having a well-balanced skill set, and so I'm always looking to improve my front-end development skills. Check out some of my projects [here]({{site_url}}/projects), or my resume [here]({{site_url}}/resume). Feel free to [get in touch!]({{site_url}}/contact)
