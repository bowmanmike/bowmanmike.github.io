![Mike Bowman](/assets/bitmaker_portrait_cropped.jpg){: .about-portrait }

I'm Mike, a Ruby on Rails developer in Toronto. I'm currently learning full-stack development at [Bitmaker](http://bitmaker.co), here in Toronto. Since studying history and philosophy at university, I've known I'd need a job where I’d be challenged on a daily basis. After a roundabout journey through food service, Germany, and coffee-snobbery, I re-discovered coding. I was quickly reminded why I liked it in the first place, and decided to dive in. In coding, I’ve found an outlet for the creative, problem-solving part of myself, and find deep satisfaction in seeing my ideas come to life.

I'm interested in all aspects of Web Development at the moment, and am looking to get to work in the field pretty soon! I'm always looking to meet people in the industry, so get in touch!
