I'm an aspiring web developer from Toronto. I'm currently learning full stack development at [Bitmaker Labs](http://www.bitmakerlabs.com), here in Toronto. I'm interested in Ruby on Rails development, and trying to learn more about the front-end too! I'm always looking to improve my CSS skills, and I've been working lately on adding Javascript and jQuery to my arsenal. In the future, I plan on becoming familiar with a front-end Javacsript framework (though I'm not yet sure which one), and really solidifying my skills with Rails.

I'm looking get my foot in the door in the web industry in Toronto, whether through freelance work, a full-time position at a small or medium sized company in the city, or an internship/apprenticeship type program.
