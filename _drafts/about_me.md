I'm from Toronto, and studied history and philosophy at the University of King's College in Halifax. Upon graduating, I discovered that it turns out "Philosopher" isn't a job any more, and that my only option (if I wanted to make use of my degree) was to stick with academia. I decided pretty quickly that the academic life wasn't for me, and set off on a journey that led me through food service, Germany, barista-ing, and finally back to Toronto, where I discovered Bitmaker Labs, and decided to go for it. Having no real coding background, I knew it would be a rather large challenge, but I had a feeling that I'd be up to the task. Writing code satisfies the critical-thinking-problem-solving part of my brain, which had lain dormant since I finished university. The good feelings from solving problems never goes away, the problems just get bigger. I'm thrilled to be where I am today, and am totally excited to see what's yet to come.
